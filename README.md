### **1. **Create a Flask API with specific endpoints:**

- **`/api/metrics/domain-authority`**: Fetches the Domain Authority of a domain.
- **`/api/metrics/page-authority`**: Fetches the Page Authority of a domain.
- **`/api/metrics/domain-rating`**: Fetches the Domain Rating of a domain.
- **`/api/metrics/trust-flow`**: Fetches the Trust Flow of a domain.
- **`/api/metrics/citation-flow`**: Fetches the Citation Flow of a domain.
- **`/api/metrics/spam-score`**: Fetches the Spam Score of a domain.
- **`/api/metrics/referring-domains`**: Fetches the Referring Domains of a domain.
- **`/api/metrics/total-backlinks`**: Fetches the Total Backlinks of a domain.
- **`/api/metrics/all`**: Fetches all metrics related to a domain.
- **`/api/scrape`**: Allows scraping of metrics for multiple domains.

**:** Includes these endpoints and adheres to the rate limiting and caching specifications for each.

### **2. Implement rate limiting and caching:**

- **Rate Limiting:** I've used Flask-Limiter to enforce rate limits like `5 per minute` for most endpoints and `2 per minute` for the scraping endpoint.
- **Caching:** Flask-Caching is utilized to cache the responses for 60 seconds, which helps reduce redundant API calls and improves performance.

**:** Includes rate limiting and caching configurations correctly, ensuring that the API usage is controlled and responses are optimized.

### **3. Implementing domain metrics calculations:**

- Functions like `calculate_domain_authority`, `calculate_page_authority`, `calculate_domain_rating`, `calculate_trust_flow`, `calculate_citation_flow`, `calculate_spam_score` are used to compute various metrics.
- **Scraping Functions:** The methods like `get_referring_domains`, `get_total_backlinks`, `get_trust_score`, `get_spam_score` scrape data from relevant sources.

**:** implements the logic for calculating various domain metrics, fetching data, and handling exceptions.

### **4. Data Persistence and Handling:**

- **Database Model:** `DomainMetrics` is defined with columns for various metrics and is used to save and fetch domain data.
- **Scraping and Saving Metrics:** The `scrape_and_save_metrics` function scrapes metrics and saves them to the database, updating existing records or creating new ones as needed.

**:** Properly integrates SQLAlchemy for data persistence and ensures that the metrics are stored and updated efficiently.

### **5. Front-End Implementation:**

- **HTML Form for Scraping:** Allows users to input domains and trigger scraping.
- **Metrics Fetching Form:** Enables users to fetch and view domain metrics.
- **Charts Display:** Uses Chart.js to visualize the metrics.

**:** Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API, including forms for scraping and fetching metrics, and visualizations for displaying data.

### **Additional Points:**

- **Error Handling:** Logs errors and provides user-friendly messages if something goes wrong.
- **CORS:** Enabled to allow cross-origin requests, which is useful if the front-end is hosted on a different domain.
